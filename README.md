## üí•Key Features
* Simple and easy to use
* No external dependencies, easy to port

## üéâInstallation
Extract to the httpcat directory:
```bash
tar -zxvf httpcat_*.tar.gz -C httpcat
```

Modify configuration file:
```bash
cd httpcat
vi ./conf/svr.yml
```

linux:
```bash
./httpcat -C conf/svr.yml
```

windows:
```bash
httpcat.exe --upload /home/web/website/download/ --download /home/web/website/download/ -C F:\open_code\httpcat\server\conf\svr.yml
```

```bash
# ./httpcat -h
Usage of ./httpcat:
  -C, --config string     ConfigPath (default "./conf/svr.yml")
      --download string   Specify the path for downloading files, ending with a forward slash (/) (default "./website/download/")
  -P, --port int          host port.
      --static string     Specify the path for static resources (web), ending with a forward slash (/) (default "./website/static/")
      --upload string     Specify the path for uploading files, ending with a forward slash (/) (default "./website/upload/")
```


### Run in the background using tmux
You can use tmux to run in the background:
```bash
Create a new tmux session using a socket file named tmux_httpcat
$ tmux -S tmux_httpcat

#  Once inside tmux, you can execute running commands, such as:
httpcat --static=/home/web/website/upload/  -C server/conf/svr.yml

Move process to background by detaching
Ctrl+b d OR ‚åò+b d (Mac)

To re-attach
$ tmux -S tmux_httpcat attach

Alternatively, you can use the following single command to both create (if not exists already) and attach to a session:
$ tmux new-session -A -D -s tmux_httpcat

To delete farming session
$ tmux kill-session -t tmux_httpcat
```


### Linux can use systemd to run in the background
```bash
cp  httpcat.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpcat.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start httpcat
```

> Note: You may need to modify the startup parameters according to your needs. 
> Ensure that the following three directories are consistent (so that the upload directory is also the download directory, 
> and it is also the web frontend directory where files can be downloaded without authentication).

```bash
vi httpcat.service
```
```
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/httpcat  --static=/home/web/website/upload/  --upload=/home/web/website/upload/ --download=/home/web/website/upload/  -C /etc/httpdcat/svr.yml
```


## ‚ù§ Tips and Tricks
### File Operation Related APIs
#### Uploading Files Using Curl Tool
```bash
curl -vF "f1=@/root/hello.mojo" http://localhost:8888/api/v1/file/upload
```
The curl command is used to send a multipart/form-data format POST request to the specified URL. Here is an explanation of each part:
- `curl`:  curl is a tool used for transferring data to/from a server, supporting multiple protocols.
- `-v`: Detailed operational information is displayed during command execution, which is known as verbose mode.
- `-F "f1=@/root/hello.mojo"`: Specifies the form data to be sent. The -F option indicates that a form is being sent, and f1=@/root/hello.mojo indicates that the file field to be uploaded is named f1, with the file path /root/hello.mojo. The value of this field is the relative or absolute path to the local file.
- `http://localhost:8888/api/v1/file/upload`: Ë¶ÅÂèëÈÄÅËØ∑Ê±ÇÂà∞ÁöÑ URLÔºåËøôÊù°ÂëΩ‰ª§‰ºöÂ∞ÜÊñá‰ª∂‰∏ä‰º†Âà∞Ëøô‰∏™ URL„ÄÇ

> Note: f1 is defined in the server-side code. Modifying it to something else, such as file, will result in an error and the upload will fail.


#### File Upload Authentication
If the enable_upload_token option is enabled in the configuration file, file uploads require authentication. You need to add a token in the request header, where the token value should match the enable_upload_token value specified in the configuration file.
An independent upload token credential is generated based on the app_key and app_secret. When uploading a file, include the token in the request. The server will then verify the validity of the token.



http://{{ip}}:{{port}}/api/v1/user/createUploadToken
POST
{
"accessKey": "httpcat",
"secretKey": "httpcat_app_secret"
}
‰æãÂ¶ÇËøîÂõûÔºö
{
"code": 0,
"msg": "success",
"data": "httpcat:dZE8NVvimYNbV-YpJ9EFMKg3YaM=:eyJkZWFkbGluZSI6MH0="
}


```bash
curl -v -F "f1=@/root/hello.mojo" -H "UploadToken: httpcat:bbE8NVvimYNbV-CaJ9EFMKg3YaM=:eyJkZWFkbGluZSI6M15=" http://localhost:8888/api/v1/file/upload
```

####  Upload file Enterprise WeChat webhook notification.
Configure the persistent_notify_url in the svr.yml file. After a successful upload, an Enterprise WeChat notification will be sent.

The notification message is as follows:

File upload archived, upload information:
- IP Address: 192.168.31.3
- Upload Time: 2023-11-29 23:07:04
- File Name: syslog.md
- File Size: 4.88 KB
- File MD5: 8346ecb8e6342d98a9738c5409xxx

#### Support SQLite to retain upload history.
If the enable_sqlite option is enabled in the configuration, uploaded files will be recorded in an SQLite database. You can use the `sqlite` command-line tool to query the upload history records.

Use the `sqlite` command-line tool to create a database and query data.

```bash
sudo apt install sqlite3
sqlite3 --version
```

Run the following command to connect to an SQLite database and specify the filename for the database to be created (e.g., sqlite.db):
```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db
```

At the sqlite3 prompt, enter the .tables command to list all the tables in the database:
```bash
.tables
```

```bash
SELECT * FROM notifications;
```


#### ‰∏ãËΩΩÊñá‰ª∂
##### api Êé•Âè£
View the list of files in a specific directory within the download root.
`http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/v1/file/listFiles?dir=
`
Download a specific file.
`http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/v1/file/download?filename=xxx.jpg
`
Get information about a specific file, including its MD5 hash.
`http://{{ip}}:{{port}}/api/v1/file/fileInfo?name=FlF9mrjXgAAZHon.jpg
`


### P2P Related APIs
P2P functionality needs to be enabled in the configuration file, which is disabled by default.

#### Sending messages to the P2P network via HTTP API
http://{{ip}}:{{port}}/api/v1/p2p/send_message
POST
{
"topic": "httpcat",
"message": "ceshi cccccccccccc"
}
